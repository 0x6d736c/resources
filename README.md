## Podcasts

### [Programming Throwdown](http://www.programmingthrowdown.com/)
Programming Throwdown attempts to educate Computer Scientists and Software Engineers on a cavalcade of programming and tech topics. Every show will cover a new programming language, so listeners will be able to speak intelligently about any programming language.

### [Coding Blocks](https://www.codingblocks.net/)
Pragmatic talk about software design best practices: design patterns, software architecture, coding for performance, object oriented programming, database design and implementation, tips, tricks and a whole lot more. You'll be exposed to broad areas of information as well as deep dives into the guts of a programming language. Most topics discussed are relevant in any number of Object Oriented programming languages such as C#, Java, Ruby, PHP, etc.. All three of us are full stack web and database / software engineers so we discuss Javascript, HTML, SQL and a full spectrum of technologies and are open to any suggestions anyone might have for a topic. So please join us, subscribe, and invite your computer programming friends to come along for the ride.
